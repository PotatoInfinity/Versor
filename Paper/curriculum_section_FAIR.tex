\subsection{Memory-Constrained Curriculum Generalization}

State-space models like Versor (RRA) and graph networks (GNS) operate with O(1) memory by compressing sequence history into a fixed-dimensional state, enabling deployment on long-horizon tasks where O(L²) Transformer attention becomes prohibitive. To evaluate robustness within this memory constraint, we trained models on short sequences (L=50) and tested zero-shot transfer to longer sequences (L=100, 150).

Versor (RRA) & O(1) & 0.07 & 9.47$\times$ & \textbf{11.44$\times$} \\

\end{table}

\textbf{Analysis:} Within the O(1) memory constraint, Versor demonstrates \textbf{40$\times$ better robustness} than GNS when generalizing to longer sequences (11$\times$ vs 450$\times$ degradation at L=150). GNS exhibits catastrophic failure because graph-based features are learned in a position-dependent manner that fails to transfer across temporal scales. Versor's geometric rotor accumulation, while imperfect, maintains scale-invariant relationships that partially transfer.

Transformer achieves superior generalization (2.6$\times$ degradation) but requires O(L) memory to cache full sequence history, making it impractical for long-horizon deployment where L$>$1000. For example, at L=10,000, Transformer would require 10,000$\times$ the memory of Versor or GNS. This comparison demonstrates that within practical memory constraints, Versor provides the best tradeoff: \textbf{40$\times$ more robust than GNS while using equivalent memory}.

\textbf{Practical Implication:} For deployment scenarios requiring long-horizon predictions with bounded memory (e.g., robotic control, real-time simulation), Versor's geometric structure is preferred over graph-based methods despite marginally lower in-distribution performance (Table 2). The 40$\times$ robustness advantage ensures stable operation when test conditions exceed training distribution.
